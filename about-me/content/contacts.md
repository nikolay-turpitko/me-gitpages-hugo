**Privacy disclaimer:**

I do not need any of your personal information, do not request for it and do
not collect it.

This website does not use cookies and does not require JavaScript (which is
used, though, if enabled in the web browser, to implement call-back form and
buttons).

If you are concerned about your privacy, you may use a nickname instead of your
real name as well as a temporary contact information.  I will use this
information only to contact you back and will not share it with third parties
without your permission (except situations of law enforcement requests,
properly issued by Russian authorities).

You are free to choose any way of communication you deem as more private.

Please notice, that any information your enter in web forms or applications can
be available not only to addressee, but also to the provider of the web form or
application (such as Google, Telegram, Skype, Formspree, etc) as well as to
internet service providers, and can be subject of man-in-the-middle attacks. I
can not guarantee that any communication channel I use is free from leaks.

Take into consideration privacy policies of the service provider of your
choice.

This disclaimer was added due recent lawsuits against call-back form owners in
Russian Federation.
